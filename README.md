# Building Elevation Design Project

This project showcases an AutoCAD design of a multi-story building elevation. The design highlights a clean, symmetrical structure with detailed architectural elements, including windows, doors, and a boundary wall. The layout provides a side view of the building, making it suitable for planning and visualizing structural aesthetics.

### Project Features:
- *Three-Story Structure*: A detailed elevation view of a three-story building.
- *Facade Detailing*: Brick patterns and window placements are highlighted for architectural emphasis.
- *Windows and Doors*: Strategically positioned for natural light and accessibility.
- *Boundary Wall*: A surrounding wall for added security and privacy.

This project demonstrates the use of precise measurements and attention to structural details, making it a valuable reference for building elevation planning.
